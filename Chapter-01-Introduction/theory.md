 Chapter 1: Introduction to Kubernetes Administration

 1.1 What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, it is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

 Key Features:
- Container Orchestration: Automated container deployment and management
- Self-healing: Automatically replaces and reschedules containers
- Horizontal Scaling: Scale applications up or down with simple commands
- Load Balancing: Distributes network traffic to ensure application stability
- Automated Rollouts/Rollbacks: Change application states with controlled rates
- Secret Management: Manage sensitive information
- Storage Orchestration: Automatically mount storage systems

 1.2 Core Concepts

 1.2.1 Containers
- Lightweight, standalone executable packages
- Include all dependencies (runtime, system tools, libraries)
- Consistent environment across development and production
- Popular runtimes: Docker, containerd, CRI-O

 1.2.2 Pods
- Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- Can contain one or more containers
- Share network namespace and storage
- Always scheduled together
- Example use cases:
  * Single container pods
  * Main application with helper containers
  * Tightly coupled service combinations

 1.2.3 Nodes
- Physical or virtual machines running containers
- Types:
  * Master Nodes (Control Plane)
  * Worker Nodes
- Resources managed:
  * CPU
  * Memory
  * Storage
  * Network

 1.2.4 Clusters
- Set of nodes that run containerized applications
- Provides:
  * High Availability
  * Load Balancing
  * Resource Management
  * Scalability

 1.3 Kubernetes Architecture Overview

 1.3.1 Control Plane Components
1. API Server
   - Frontend for Kubernetes control plane
   - RESTful API endpoint
   - Validates and processes requests
   - Primary management point

2. Scheduler
   - Watches for new Pods with no assigned node
   - Considers:
     * Resource requirements
     * Hardware/software/policy constraints
     * Affinity/anti-affinity
     * Data locality

3. Controller Manager
   - Runs controller processes
   - Types:
     * Node Controller: Monitors node health
     * Replication Controller: Maintains pod count
     * Endpoints Controller: Populates endpoints
     * Service Account & Token Controllers: Manage access

4. etcd
   - Consistent and highly-available key value store
   - Stores all cluster data
   - Critical for cluster state management
   - Requires backup planning

 1.3.2 Worker Node Components

1. Kubelet
   - Primary node agent
   - Ensures containers are running in Pod
   - Manages:
     * Container lifecycle
     * Volume mounting
     * Pod specification execution
     * Node health reporting

2. Container Runtime
   - Software responsible for running containers
   - Options:
     * Docker
     * containerd
     * CRI-O
   - Manages:
     * Image pulling
     * Container execution
     * Resource isolation

3. Kube-proxy
   - Network proxy on each node
   - Implements part of Service concept
   - Maintains network rules
   - Enables:
     * Pod-to-Pod communication
     * Pod-to-Service communication
     * External access
